"This university ticketing system is a comprehensive React.js application designed to streamline support ticket management between students and administrators. The system features two distinct role-based interfaces: an admin dashboard for managing and updating ticket statuses, and a student portal for submitting tickets and tracking their progress. The application uses mock data to simulate real-time ticket updates with three status levels (pending, in-progress, resolved), each with distinct color coding for immediate visual recognition. The design emphasizes modern UI principles with glassmorphism effects, smooth Framer Motion animations, and a professional university aesthetic using blue and white color schemes. Key technical features include React Hook Form for validated ticket submissions, date-fns for timestamp formatting, role-based routing, and responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly across devices. The system maintains ticket history, provides intuitive navigation, and implements hover animations and progress indicators to enhance user experience. All data is simulated through mock files (mockTicketsData.js, mockUsersData.js) to demonstrate full functionality without backend dependencies.\\n\\n**Last changes:** Initial project setup with complete admin dashboard, student portal, ticket management components, mock data structures, role-based navigation, and responsive design implementation with professional university branding."
